# WEBDEV REPOSITORY

<h2 align="center">Udemy's API Section</h2>

This is the API section of Udemy's web development course. According to MuleSoft, "API is the acronym for **Application Programming Interface**, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message or check the weather on your phone, you’re using an API."<a href="#1">¹</a> 

The history of web-based APIs start when Salesforce launched its sales automation tool, in the late 1990s, marking the beginning of Software as a Service-SaaS.<a href="#2">²</a>(PURKAYASTHA, 2020). As time goes by, this type of application evolved to model a real-world operation. *Representational State Transfer framework*-**REST** has its responsibility share in that evolutionary process. "The REST architecture is a set of guidelines and recommendations for **defining API interfaces that model real-world objects**. This is, in a way, similar to how software architectures have evolved from procedural to object-oriented paradigms, with individual software components representing an object."<a href="#1">³</a>(PURKAYASTHA, 2020). But this era is already at its end, as the real-time collaborations between human-machine become more usual, the request-respond paradigm has proven to be limited, now is emerging an *event-driven paradigm*.

The way that websites are developed is changing, but API is definitely a part of it. Another important point is that each server may provide access to its API, and usually, they already have a document showing *how to use our API*, with a template code, where the API's key goes, and you're ready to go. This process of implementing an API into your webpage makes it easier to deploy functionalities that wouldn't be possible otherwise. For example, imagine that you need to develop a website for a food delivery application; without an API, you would have the work of creating all the map databases requested, thus making an impossible job, but using an API the effort spent on this task becomes trivial. Therefore, knowing how to use an API is mandatory in the web developer's knowledge toolkit.
