<a name="whatis"><h3>What is a landing page?</h3></a>

A landing page is a webpage degign to demonstrate a service, app or product. "From content structure to visual design elements, everything on a landing page for an app website needs to come together to turn a visitor into an engaged user."¹(CARDELLO, 2020) Therefore, bootstrap is quite useful when it comes to create landing pages, because this framework has powerfull tools to design it.  
"In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web."²
