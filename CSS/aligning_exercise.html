		<p class="right">Here it's align to the right, inside a 500px wide green div box.</p>
		<p class="center">Here it's centered, inside a 500px wide green div box.</p>
		<p class="justify">Here it's justified, inside a 500px wide green div box. I will fill in the spaces so it'll be clear that the text is really justified. Not just align to the left. This words it's just a bunch of nonsense.</p>
