#HTML SECTION

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and despite some people's belief, it isn't a programming language because it lacks logical constructs.
HTML is used to add context and structure to a webpage. This structure is defined as head and body, in which you can apply the tags to generate content and information.
In this section, these tags were applied to create some functionalities, such as forms, lists, links, images, and more.
At the end of this section, a simple webpage was designed using HTML. 
Ps.: It's not important the info inside that page, it was just an exercise.
