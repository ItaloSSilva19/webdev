Javascript is the most popular programming language. It was standardized to ECMAScript as a cross-platform Internet standard for scripting, but everyone calls it Javascript.
With this language, it can be done complex things on the web page like interactive maps, amination, buttons, and more.
In this section, Javascript was used to create iterators, conditional statements, functions, buttons, loops, and more.
In the end a project was developed. It consists of a game that calculates the time that the user takes to click at a circle or a rectangle that appears and disappears randomly in the browser.
