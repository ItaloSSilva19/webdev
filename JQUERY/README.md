Jquery is a Javascript library. It can be used to do more with less coding.
This API makes it easier to do things like:
-HTML document transversal and manipulation;
-Event handling;
-Animation;
-Ajax.


In this course, it was made an introduction to Jquery. Here, in these files, there are examples of animating, ajax, how to detect a click, changing the style, etc. At the end of this section, there is a project.
This project consists of making a code player where you can code and see the output on the same page. Also, you can code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
