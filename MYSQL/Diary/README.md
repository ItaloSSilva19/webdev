#MySQL Project: Diary

The objective of this project was to create a diary blog, in which the users can write whatever they want.
This goal has been achieved in two parts. The first was the "user's profile" part, which can be reused; and the other part is the diary itself. To do that, two forms were created, one for the sign-up, another to log in.
Also, a database was created; these forms were connected with it; security measures were taken( password md5 encryption); cookie was established to maintain a session; the validations were made to ensure useability.
After the user signs up or logs in on the website's first page, the text area can be written and the text will be saved automatically on the database. Therefore completing the project second part. 

Tools that has been used in this project are:
	-HTML - To create the structure of the website;
	-Bootstrap - Responsible for the style of the page (check the bootstrap folder to more info about this framework);
	-jQuery - Front-end logic of the page;
	-Ajax - To connect the diary text with the database;
	-PHP - Back-end logic of the page;
	-MySQL - To manage the database;

Also, I'm using Filezilla to upload the files to "https://www.ecowebhosting.co.uk/". The database is as well hosted there.	
Furthermore, it's important to mention that this project is an exercise of an Udemy course: "the complete web developer course-2".
