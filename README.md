<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction:</h3></a>

In this repository, it will be covered some of the tools needed to develop a website. To make it easier to follow through, those tools are divided into sections which are enumerated on the <a href="#section">Files Sections"</a>. Also, for each section, there is an article explaining the basics concepts for there tool, a few exercises to illustrate what was taught, and a challenge to measure the understanding of that section. As a recommendation, before looking at the challenge's code, try to do it by yourself. Also, be informed that **ALL** of the content here is was thought as an introductory level. Without further ado let's begin!

Before learning about web development, it is needed to understand what is the internet and how it works; after all, a website is hosted on the internet.

<a name="internet"><h3>The internet:</h3></a>

<h5>What is the internet?</h5>

According to Ian Sample's article on The Guardian<a href="#biblio">¹</a>, "The internet is the wider network that allows computer networks around the world run by companies, governments, universities, and other organizations to talk to one another. The result is a mass of cables, computers, data centers, routers, servers, repeaters, satellites, and wifi towers that allows digital information to travel around the world."(2018) So, basically, the internet is a bunch of people communicating with each other through electronic devices.

<h5>How the internet works?</h5>

In communication, someone sends a message to someone, and on the internet isn't so far from these. Of course, this process is more complex than this oversimplification, but the essence remains true. The foundation of internet is request and response. Bellow, there is a video link explaining this process.

<a name="webdev"><h3>Web Development:</h3></a>

Now that this is clear, what is web development? Web development is the process of creating a website for hosting in the internet or intranet<a href="#1">²</a>(TECHOPEDIA, 2020). This process it's divided into two parts: the **front-end or client-side**, and the **back-end or server-side**. The first one is responsible for the structure, style, and logic processed by the web browser in the user's machine. Some of the technologies used here are: *HyperText Markup Language*-**HTML**(structure of the webpage), *Cascading Style Sheets*-**CSS**(style of the webpage), and *Javascript*-**JS**(the logic of the webpage). The last part is responsible for the database management, security, and logic processed by the server. This can be done using *PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor*-**PHP**, **PYTHON**(the logic process by the server), and **MySQL**(database management).
